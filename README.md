• Utilize bar charts to represent mean values for cases and deaths, and overlay them with error bars representing the standard deviations. • This visual representation provides a clear comparison across countries and time periods.

    Scatter Plots:
• Use scatter plots to display individual data points against the mean. • This visualization helps identify outliers and understand the data distribution around the mean.

4.Innovative Approaches 4.1 Advanced Visualization Techniques: Dynamic Comparison Charts: • Interactive charts enabling users to compare mean values and standard deviations dynamically. • Users can select specific countries or time periods for focused analysis.

  Regression Analysis:
• Implement regression models to identify trends over time, providing insights into the trajectory of COVID-19 cases and deaths. • This aids in forecasting and trend prediction.

4.2 Predictive Analytics:

  Machine Learning Models:
• Utilize machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling. • Algorithms like Random Forest or LSTM can forecast future mean values and standard deviations based on historical data, providing valuable insights for proactive planning.

5.Insights and Decision Support Through meticulous mean and standard deviation analysis, coupled with innovative techniques, we aim to extract actionable insights:

Identification of High-Risk Periods: • Pinpoint specific days or weeks with unusually high standard deviations, indicating periods of significant volatility in COVID-19 cases. • This insight aids in resource allocation and preparedness.

Comparative Analysis: • Compare mean values and standard deviations between countries to identify variations in pandemic management strategies. • Understanding the differences can provide valuable lessons for other regions.

Predictive Insights: • Utilize machine learning predictions to foresee potential spikes in cases or deaths. Timely intervention during these periods can significantly impact the outcome of the pandemic.

6.Machine learning algorithm for predictive analysis Linear regression is a suitable algorithm for predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths when you want to understand the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and the number of cases or deaths. In your case, you can use it to predict the number of cases or deaths based on specific variables from the provided dataset. Here's how you can implement linear regression using IBM Cognos and the given dataset: Steps for Implementing Linear Regression in IBM Cognos:

1.Data Loading: Import the COVID-19 cases and deaths dataset into IBM Cognos. Ensure the dataset is cleaned, and missing values are handled appropriately.

2.Data Exploration: • Explore the dataset to understand the available variables and their distributions. • Identify potential independent variables (features) that could influence the number of cases or deaths. These variables could include factors like population density, healthcare facilities, government policies, etc.

3.Data Preparation: • Select the relevant independent variable(s) (features) and the target variable (number of cases or deaths). • Split the data into training and testing sets. A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

4.Model Building: • In IBM Cognos, navigate to the modeling section and choose Linear Regression as the algorithm. • Select the independent variable(s) as input features and the number of cases or deaths as the target variable. • Train the model using the training dataset.

5.Model Evaluation: • Evaluate the model using the testing dataset to assess its performance. • Common evaluation metrics for regression models include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (coefficient of determination).

6.Interpretation and Visualization: • Interpret the coefficients of the linear regression equation to understand the impact of each independent variable on the number of cases or deaths. • Visualize the regression line along with the actual data points to observe the fit of the model.

7.Iterative Refinement: Based on the model performance, you might need to iterate: include more features, handle outliers, or try other regression algorithms if linear regression does not provide satisfactory results.

8.Prediction: Once you are satisfied with the model, you can use it for predicting the number of COVID-19 cases or deaths based on new data or future time periods.

CREATING MEAN VISUALIZATION : Create a Query: Start by creating a query in IBM Cognos based on the imported dataset, selecting specific columns: date, cases, and deaths. Aggregate the Data: Use aggregation functions in IBM Cognos to calculate mean values for cases and deaths. For cases, apply the "mean" or "average" aggregation function to the "cases" column. For deaths, use the same aggregation function on the "deaths" column. Group the data by the "date" column to calculate mean values for each date. Run the Query: Execute the query to obtain aggregated data, resulting in mean values for COVID-19 cases and deaths for each date in the dataset. Create Visualizations: Utilize the aggregated data to create visualizations such as line charts or bar charts. Dates are plotted on the X-axis, and mean values for cases and deaths are represented on the Y-axis. These visualizations provide clear insights into the trends of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.

CREATING STANDARD DEVIATION VISUALIZATION : Create a Query: Begin by creating a query in IBM Cognos based on the imported dataset, selecting specific columns: Date, Cases, and Deaths.

Aggregate the Data (Standard Deviation): Utilize aggregation functions in IBM Cognos to calculate standard deviation values for Cases and Deaths. For Cases, apply the "Standard Deviation" aggregation function to the "Cases" column. For Deaths, use the same aggregation function on the "Deaths" column. Group the data by the "Date" column to calculate standard deviation values for each date. Run the Query: Execute the query to obtain aggregated data, resulting in standard deviation values for COVID-19 cases and deaths for each date in the dataset. Create Visualizations: Utilize the aggregated data to create visualizations such as bar charts or line charts. Dates are plotted on the X-axis, and standard deviation values for cases and deaths are represented on the Y-axis. These visualizations provide a clear overview of the variability in COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.
