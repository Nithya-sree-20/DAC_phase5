2.Data Segmentation To ensure a meticulous analysis, the dataset will be segmented by both time periods and countries. Time Periods: • Segmentation into daily, weekly, and monthly intervals enables us to capture short-term fluctuations and long-term trends effectively. Countries: • Individual analysis of EU/EEA countries provides a detailed understanding of regional variations, aiding in targeted interventions.

3.Mean and Standard Deviation Analysis 3.1 Calculation Steps: Mean Calculation: For each country and time period, calculate the average number of daily COVID-19 cases and deaths. This provides a central value representing the typical daily occurrence. Formula: Mean = (Sum of values) / (Number of days)

Standard Deviation Calculation: Determine the variation or dispersion of data points from the mean for each country and time period. Formula: Standard Deviation = √[(Σ(xi - μ)²) / N], where xi is each data point, μ is the mean, and N is the number of data points.

3.2 Visualization Techniques:

   Bar Charts with Error Bars:
• Utilize bar charts to represent mean values for cases and deaths, and overlay them with error bars representing the standard deviations. • This visual representation provides a clear comparison across countries and time periods.

    Scatter Plots:
• Use scatter plots to display individual data points against the mean. • This visualization helps identify outliers and understand the data distribution around the mean.

4.Innovative Approaches 4.1 Advanced Visualization Techniques: Dynamic Comparison Charts: • Interactive charts enabling users to compare mean values and standard deviations dynamically. • Users can select specific countries or time periods for focused analysis.

  Regression Analysis:
• Implement regression models to identify trends over time, providing insights into the trajectory of COVID-19 cases and deaths. • This aids in forecasting and trend prediction.

4.2 Predictive Analytics:

6.Machine learning algorithm for predictive analysis Linear regression is a suitable algorithm for predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths when you want to understand the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and the number of cases or deaths. In your case, you can use it to predict the number of cases or deaths based on specific variables from the provided dataset. Here's how you can implement linear regression using IBM Cognos and the given dataset: Steps for Implementing Linear Regression in IBM Cognos:

1.Data Loading: Import the COVID-19 cases and deaths dataset into IBM Cognos. Ensure the dataset is cleaned, and missing values are handled appropriately.

2.Data Exploration: • Explore the dataset to understand the available variables and their distributions. • Identify potential independent variables (features) that could influence the number of cases or deaths. These variables could include factors like population density, healthcare facilities, government policies, etc.

3.Data Preparation: • Select the relevant independent variable(s) (features) and the target variable (number of cases or deaths). • Split the data into training and testing sets. A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

4.Model Building: • In IBM Cognos, navigate to the modeling section and choose Linear Regression as the algorithm. • Select the independent variable(s) as input features and the number of cases or deaths as the target variable. • Train the model using the training dataset.

5.Model Evaluation: • Evaluate the model using the testing dataset to assess its performance. • Common evaluation metrics for regression models include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (coefficient of determination).

6.Interpretation and Visualization: • Interpret the coefficients of the linear regression equation to understand the impact of each independent variable on the number of cases or deaths. • Visualize the regression line along with the actual data points to observe the fit of the model.

7.Iterative Refinement: Based on the model performance, you might need to iterate: include more features, handle outliers, or try other regression algorithms if linear regression does not provide satisfactory results.

8.Prediction: Once you are satisfied with the model, you can use it for predicting the number of COVID-19 cases or deaths based on new data or future time periods.
